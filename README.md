# Object Oriented Programming

Final project for my OOP python unit, wanted to go above and beyond and taught myself the basics of Python UI, after going through struggles I subbmitted this result. Although it may not be the most efficient, it did get a good grade for me within my class, and taught me the basics of OOP and Python UI.

Libraries used: PySimpleGUI

*Made for Grade 12 Computer Programming*
